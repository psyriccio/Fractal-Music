This was originally developed as a project for the course
PMATH 370: Chaos and Fractals.

It was based on a paper that discussed properties of white, brown, and pink
noise as applied to music.  Any reference to this original paper has been lost,
but it seems likely it was the following:

http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~mrb/qamt/fractalmusic.pdf
("MUSIC FROM FRACTAL NOISE" by Michael Bulmer, 13 January 2000)

with the algorithm for pink music extended to music of arbitrary length
and the proprerties of each type of noise applied both to note pitch and duration.
